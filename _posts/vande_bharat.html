                        <h5 class="mb-4">A brief context</h5>
                        <p>
                            I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solapur">Solapur</a>, Maharashtra. It is
                            located in the western part of India.
                            Once a bustling industrial city, ranked third in Maharashtra only after Mumbai and Pune,
                            it has now lost its past glamour and is now a simple city with a population of around
                            1.5
                            million.
                            The city is still highly relevant in the sense that it is geographically very well
                            positioned among the major cities
                            such as Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai. It has a huge potential in terms
                            of
                            becoming a tier-1 Indian
                            city bridging Maharashtra (and possibly Gujarat) with the southern states.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vande_Bharat_Express">Vande Bharat Express</a>
                            from Solapur to Pune on 26th March 2023.
                            The Vande Bharat Express is a semi-high speed train with the maximum speed of 110 kmph.
                            An ordinary train takes 4 to 6 hours to reach Pune.
                            Vande Bharat, with its acclaimed speed, covers this distance in only about 3 hours.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="mb-4">My experience</h5>
                        <p>
                            The look and feel of the coaches is pretty impressive. The catering service is amazing.
                            First, I had a tea and few
                            digestive cookies. Later, they offered us a bellyful of breakfast -- pohe, puri bhaji,
                            mango
                            pickle, diet chiwda,
                            chocopie, mango juice and dahi.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As for the train-wide announcements and automatically opening doors, they were not new
                            to me
                            since I use Delhi metro
                            regularly. Nonetheless, where I was sitting, there was an excitement about how these
                            things
                            work.
                            We did have a laugh at a few grammatical mistakes in the Marathi announcements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Occupancy was great. The bogey in which I was travelling, it was full. The <a
                                href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/solapur-shirdi-vande-bharat-trains-witness-good-footfall-8512077/">statistics
                                from Central Railway</a> also confirm
                            the trend. Apparently, the occupancy is about 84% for Solapur-Mumbai-Solapur route and is
                            steadily increasing. In present
                            era, nobody minds spending 1000-1500 Rupees to travel faster.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I saw kids, youngsters and adults clicking photos and videos of the train, both inside
                            as
                            well as outside. Villages in
                            my district like the ones in Karmala taluka, people were struck by the beauty and the
                            agility of this beast. Seemed like
                            some folks were waiting for the train to arrive so that they could watch her majestic
                            run.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I loved travelling with this train. I would recommend people to make a journey to
                            Solapur on Vande Bharat. My suggestion would be to plan out a weekend trip with family to
                            visit nearby holy places like Akkalkot, Pandharpur and Tuljapur.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="mb-4">And now... the prequel of the story</h5>

                        <p>
                            Solapur had an operating flight connecting to Mumbai run by <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingfisher_Airlines">Kingfisher Airlines</a>, before
                            it
                            went bankrupt. Few years went
                            by and
                            when new players came in to continue operating flights, they found illegal constructions
                            around airport which made it
                            unsafe to
                            fly planes at the existing airport. It elongated into a decade long no-fly blockade, the <a
                                href="https://www.loksatta.com/maharashtra/solapur-siddheshwar-sugar-factory-chimney-to-be-demolished-to-avoid-air-accident-zws-70-2703800/">infamous
                                chimney</a>
                            is considered the symbol of which.
                            The city
                            has seen multiple mayors and commissioners (<a
                                href="https://www.indianbureaucracy.com/p-siva-sankar-ias-posted-as-director-textiles-maharashtra/">P.
                                Siva Sankar</a> being the most notable), but
                            nobody has been able to get the
                            airport running.
                            Therefore, finally a request for high speed train was made to Indian government and
                            Vande
                            Bharat is the result of that.
                            So, does it
                            completely circumvent our need for a operational flight? The answer unfortunately is NO,
                            because reaching Mumbai still
                            takes 6.5 hours which could be covered in just 30-40 minutes by an aeroplane. We are waiting
                            for "The Chosen One" to solve this blockade, because our "chosen ones" have not solved it so
                            far :).
