  I took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vande_Bharat_Express">Vande Bharat Express</a>
  from Solapur, my home city, to Pune, a nearby metropolis, on 26th March 2023. This was a special occasion for me as these luxury, high-speed trains were launched only a month ago. They cut down around 25-50% of travel time of an average train journey. This blog is my journey experience jot down in few paragraphs. This is also <b>my first public blog</b>.
</p>


<h2>A brief context</h2>
<p>
  I am originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solapur">Solapur</a>, Maharashtra, located in the western India.
  Once a bustling industrial city, ranked third in Maharashtra only after Mumbai and Pune,
  it has now lost its past glamour and is now a simple city with a population of around
  1.5
  million.
  The city is still highly relevant in the modern era as, geographically, it sits in the midst of some of India's largest cities
  such as Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai. It has a huge potential of becoming a tier-1 city in the future bridging state of Maharashtra (and possibly Gujarat) with the South India.

<h2 class="mb-4">My experience traveling with Vande Bharat</h2>
<p>
  The <b>look and feel</b> of the coaches is pretty impressive. The catering service is amazing.
  First, I had a tea and few
  digestive cookies. Later, they offered us a bellyful of breakfast -- pohe, puri bhaji,
  mango
  pickle, diet chiwda,
  chocopie, mango juice and dahi.
</p>
<p>
  As for the <b>train-wide announcements and automatically opening doors</b>, they were not new
  to me
  since I use Delhi metro
  regularly. Nonetheless, where I was sitting, there was an excitement about how these
  things
  work.
  We did have a laugh at a few grammatical mistakes in the Marathi announcements.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Occupancy</b> was great. The bogey in which I was travelling, it was full. The <a
      href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/solapur-shirdi-vande-bharat-trains-witness-good-footfall-8512077/">statistics
      from Central Railway</a> also confirm
  the trend. Apparently, the occupancy is about 84% for Solapur-Mumbai-Solapur route and is
  steadily increasing. In present
  era, nobody minds spending 1000-1500 Rupees to travel faster.
</p>
<p>
  I saw kids, youngsters and adults clicking photos and videos of the train, both inside
  as
  well as outside. Villages in
  my district like the ones in Karmala taluka, people were struck by the beauty and the
  agility of this beast. Seemed like
  some folks were waiting for the train to arrive so that they could watch her majestic
  run.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, I loved travelling with this train. I would recommend people to make a journey to
  Solapur on Vande Bharat from Mumbai or Pune. My suggestion would be to plan out a weekend trip with family and
  visit nearby holy places like Akkalkot, Pandharpur, Tuljapur and Ganagapur.
</p>

<h2 class="mb-4">And now... the prequel of the story</h2>

<p>
  Solapur had an operating flight connecting to Mumbai run by <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingfisher_Airlines">Kingfisher Airlines</a>, before
  it
  went bankrupt. Few years went
  by and
  when new players came in to continue operating flights, they found illegal constructions
  around airport which made it
  unsafe to
  fly planes at the existing airport. It elongated into a decade long no-fly blockade, the <a
      href="https://www.loksatta.com/maharashtra/solapur-siddheshwar-sugar-factory-chimney-to-be-demolished-to-avoid-air-accident-zws-70-2703800/">infamous
      chimney</a>
  is considered the symbol of which.
  The city
  has seen multiple mayors and commissioners (<a
      href="https://www.indianbureaucracy.com/p-siva-sankar-ias-posted-as-director-textiles-maharashtra/">P.
      Siva Sankar</a> being the most notable), but
  nobody has been able to get the
  airport running.
  Therefore, finally a request for high speed train was made to Indian government and
  Vande
  Bharat is the result of that.
  So, does it
  completely circumvent our need for a operational flight? The answer unfortunately is NO,
  because reaching Mumbai still
  takes 6.5 hours which could be covered in just 30-40 minutes by an aeroplane. We are waiting
  for "The Chosen One" to solve this blockade, because our "chosen ones" have not solved it so
  far :).
