                        <h5 class="mb-4">A brief context</h5>
                        <p>
                            I have moved from places to places in my life. From my village to Solapur, then Solapur to
                            Chennai and later to Delhi for work.
                            Recently, I moved to UMass for my Ph.D. I have met many people, lived with different set of
                            folks, have had both good and
                            not so good interactions. In this blog, I just wanted to jot down few thoughts about how
                            such change of groups affects oneself
                            individually, and few random ideas about how that would be working, and if there is any
                            golden way to get along with folks.
                            (This is not a scientific write-up, rather, a personal story telling.)
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="mb-4">The story begins...</h5>
                        <p>
                            For those of you who don't know what an equilibrium means, when multiple people interact and
                            work together, there comes a state
                            where everyone defaults to a certain behaviour. For instance, if you are with family
                            members, you are a totally different person,
                            and when you are with your work place colleagues, you act in a way that is 'professional'.
                            If you have multiple friend circles,
                            particularly, if you are like me, who has to move places to places, with a switch of
                            context, your behaviour defaults to a way
                            that is special for that particular circle with which you are hanging out. Many a times, you
                            are held in very high regard in one
                            of these circles and you would want to be equally regarded in the ones you meet in the
                            future, or you do not want to be associated
                            with a particular ideology of circle you have been part of (in)voluntarily. So, how does it
                            work? How does one carry the image you
                            want to present consistently across multiple groups without offending anyone or being seen
                            as rude?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From my personal experience, it is very dependent on the time you are going to spend in a
                            new circle and how much idea they have
                            about you, your work, your accomplishments, etc., already. In an inter-team collaboration,
                            you hardly get time to form good rapport
                            with those you are working with. I have seen research collaboration, where you drop by every
                            other week to ideate and take/give updates.
                            It is impossible to make any impression on the folks involved. But, for this blog, we will
                            not talk about these shorter interactions.
                            I am more interested in understanding how a person's moves to-and-from different circles
                            affects him/her individually and how his/her
                            self-image changes and how default behaviours form.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let's talk about the importance of group you have to hang out with. The question is how does
                            quality of people around you affect your
                            personal behaviour? To begin with, I will give an example of my class in Solapur. The batch
                            I was part of, which completed high school
                            education in 2014, was one of the exceptional batches. The reasons being -- everyone was
                            very hard working, very sincere, smart, and
                            obidient to teachers. When I moved to this school from my village, I was amazed by how good
                            these folks were and always thought of
                            myself as a fortunate guy to get to interact with these folks and learn with them. My own
                            behaviour became reciprocative to these
                            high-performing individuals and overall, I feel, the whole foundation of my future
                            achievements was laid here. Not to mention, all
                            these awesome folks are doing great in their lives today. So, let's recap. A good student
                            moves to a circle that values higher qualities
                            in a student, he improves himself and changes totally.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now comes the reason why I started writing this blog. Not always I have associated with
                            better people. Sometimes in ignorance and
                            sometimes due to the work and education constraints, I had to mix with folks with whom I
                            really shouldn't have mixed, at least in the
                            retrospect. Although you want to act in a very amenable, healthy kind of way with those
                            around you, if the other person's behaviour
                            always hurts your own self-image and distorts your ideal scenario, you are struggling with
                            circle transition. Some folks just do not want
                            to see you in the way you see yourself although you deserve to be seen that way. Yes, there
                            are caveats. If somebody wants me to
                            see him/her as the most funny person and I find it difficult to rank them as the funniest, I
                            should not simply assume him/her to funny
                            unrealistically. However, if that person is really good at humour and you can see him/her as
                            next great comedian, you should at least
                            appreciate it. The inspiration from your group really helps the individuals grow their
                            self-images, do great things and contribute overall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am not perfect either. I know my past mistakes where I have not acted in a way where I
                            have encouraged good in others. To mend things,
                            I have started noting down places where I could have, as a part of circle, done much better.
                            But, at the same time, I also take notes of
                            how the circle around me is changing my behaviour and if that's in a good way. The later
                            part is important -- How does one's behaviour change for
                            good? Who defines what is good? Are there any guidelines on what to expect from a group? The
                            answers to these questions are as diverse as it gets.
                            My thumb rule is to see whether I am happy hanging out with the folks and whether I am able
                            to pursue higher things which I want to pursue.
                            If not, then something needs to change for sure. Seeking better circle is always
                            advantageous. Again, better for me is where I am happy and
                            where the people in the circle really care about what I want to do with my life.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="mb-4">The conclusion is...</h5>
                        <p>
                            The circle you are currently in, changes your default behaviour for both good and bad. The
                            equilibrium reached has to be beneficial
                            to everyone. Otherwise, we need to change something.
                        </p>
