<p>
    I am a second-year PhD student at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
    I am originally from Maharashtra, India.
    My research interest lies in designing deployable decision making systems. I work under  <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/">Prof. Scott Niekum</a> at <i> Safe, Confident and Aligned Learning &amp; Robotics</i> (SCALAR) lab.

    Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at Adobe, India in an applied machine learning (ML) research role (2020-2023). I worked on a variety of problem statements, including semantic analysis of PDF forms, explainability of reinforcement learning (RL) agents, image editing using language, video segmentation, and more. These projects introduced me to the fascinating world of ML technology, which has the potential to have a great positive impact on the world. During my time at Adobe, I had the opportunity to spearhead a project in collaboration with Georgios Theocharous and Prof. Nan Jiang, which further solidified my decision to pursue a PhD program.

    Before joining Adobe, I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras (2016-2020).

    In my leisure time, I like to read, paint, write, and explore. My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113549015-shripad-deshmukh">goodreads reading list</a>. Some of my <a href="/paintings/">paintings</a>. Some random <a href="/year-archive/">blogs</a> (I am still improving my choice of topics and my writing in general :). As for my exploration in the US, I have been to quite a few attractions in the North-East -- Boston, Cambridge, Lake George, Cape Cod and NYC.
