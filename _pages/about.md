<p>
    I am a second-year PhD student at University of Massachusetts, Amherst working under <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/">Prof. Scott Niekum</a>'s supervision. My research interest lies in designing safe and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agents.
</p>
<p>
    Before joining UMass for my PhD, I worked at Adobe (India) in an applied machine learning (ML) research role (2020-2023). I contributed to solving problems in semantic analysis of PDF forms, explainability of reinforcement learning (RL) agents, image editing using language and video segmentation.
    Prior to that, I completed my B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras (2016-2020).

    In my leisure time, I like to read, write, and explore. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113549015-shripad-deshmukh">My goodreads reading list</a>. <a href="/year-archive/">Some random blogs</a>. Some memorable places have been to -- Newport (Rhode Island), NYC and Manali (Himalayas).
